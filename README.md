# 东北大学学位论文(Overleaf版)
## Neu Thesis-Overleaf
东北大学(沈阳)学位论文LaTex版(硕博士通用)，可直接导入[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)。

LaTex version of Northeastern University (Shenyang)'s thesis (common to master's and doctoral degrees), which can be imported directly into [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

这个模板是在[mervin0502/neuthesis](https://github.com/mervin0502/neuthesis)和[NEUAI/neuthesis-enhanced](https://github.com/NEUAI/neuthesis-enhanced)两个项目基础上修改的。

This template is based on [mervin0502/neuthesis](https://github.com/mervin0502/neuthesis) and [NEUAI/neuthesis-enhanced](https://github.com/NEUAI/ neuthesis-enhanced).

LaTex的排版的便利程度远高于Word等文字编辑软件，在有模板的情况下可以轻松地实现要求的格式和版式，并且不容易出错。但是LaTex的模板设计和环境配置都比较麻烦，现在有几个设计好的模板可供使用，并且有在线的Overleaf平台，极大地简化了LaTex的上手难度，提高了科研效率。然而，我发现这两个模板导入Overleaf后会出现一些错误，并不能直接使用，我进行了修改，并添加了字体，使得这个模板可以直接导入Overleaf使用，希望能给大家提供便利。

The ease of layout in LaTex is far superior to that of text editing software such as Word, and the required formatting and layout can be achieved easily and without error when templates are available. However, LaTex is cumbersome in terms of template design and environment configuration. There are now several well-designed templates available and there is an online Overleaf platform that greatly simplifies getting started with LaTex and improves research efficiency. However, I have found that these two templates give some errors when imported into Overleaf and are not directly usable. I have made changes and added fonts to make this template directly usable by importing into Overleaf, which I hope will provide a convenience for everyone.

如果这个模板对您有帮助的话，非常希望得到您的小星星。
