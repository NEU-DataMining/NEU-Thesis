## Neu Thesis-Overleaf
|[中文](https://github.com/sci-m-wang/NEU-Thesis/edit/main/zh.md)|[English](https://github.com/sci-m-wang/NEU-Thesis/edit/main/README.md)|

LaTex version of Northeastern University (Shenyang)'s thesis (common to master's and doctoral degrees), which can be imported directly into [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). **If you need the English version, you can find it [here](https://github.com/sci-m-wang/NEU-Thesis/tree/main/NEU-Thesis-en).**

If this template has been helpful to you, a **star** would be greatly appreciated.

This template is based on [mervin0502/neuthesis](https://github.com/mervin0502/neuthesis) and [NEUAI/neuthesis-enhanced](https://github.com/NEUAI/ neuthesis-enhanced).

The ease of layout in LaTex is far superior to that of text editing software such as Word, and the required formatting and layout can be achieved easily and without error when templates are available. However, LaTex is cumbersome in terms of template design and environment configuration. There are now several well-designed templates available and there is an online Overleaf platform that greatly simplifies getting started with LaTex and improves research efficiency. However, I have found that these two templates give some errors when imported into Overleaf and are not directly usable. I have made changes and added fonts to make this template directly usable by importing into Overleaf, which I hope will provide a convenience for everyone.
